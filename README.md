## Playing the game

 ![Gameplay Screenshot](https://github.com/nachomonkey/Interplanetary-Invaders/blob/master/wiki_data/screenshot_gameplay1.png  "Gameplay Screenshot")

After launching the game and selecting **Play**, a list of profiles appears. (Profiles are stored in the data directory). Once a profile
is selected, map mode is entered. After selecting a mission and continuing through the briefing and inventory menus,
a mission begins. The controls are **LEFT** and **RIGHT** to move (or **a** and **d**) and **SPACE**, **UP**, or **w** to fire.

At some point you will encounter an item (![Item](interplanetary_invaders/images/bitmap/animations/items/block/block1.png  "Item"))
After touching an item, it will disappear and go into your item storage ( ![Item storage](interplanetary_invaders/images/bitmap/itemHolder.png))
An icon representing the item will be visible in your item storage.
Press the number key on your keyboard that equals the one below the item's icon (i.e. If the item is in slot three, it
will have a "3" under it, and you must press the <**3**> key to activate it.)  You can also press <**Y**> to activate items.  The items vary from mission to mission (and planet to planet).

### Hints

When using the "2x Fire Rate" item without the "Auto Gun" item, it is easiest to fire faster
by pressing the **UP** key.

Press **F2** to take screenshots. Screenshots get stored in your *data* directory. The data directory's position gets printed
when the game launches.
